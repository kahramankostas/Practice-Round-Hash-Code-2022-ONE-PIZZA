    "You are opening a small pizzeria. In fact, your pizzeria is **so** small that you decided to offer only **one type of pizza**. Now you need to decide what ingredients to include (peppers? tomatoes? both?).\n",
    "\n",
    "Everyone has their own pizza preferences. Each of your potential clients has some ingredients they like, and maybe some ingredients they dislike. Each client will come to your pizzeria if both conditions are true:\n",

    "2. **none** of the ingredients they dislike are on the pizza\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Each client is OK with additional ingredients they neither like or dislike being present on the pizza. Your task is to choose which ingredients to put on your only pizza type, to maximize the number of clients that will visit your pizzeria.\n",

    "## Input\n",
    "* The first line contains one integer $ 1 \\leqslant  C \\leqslant {10}^{5}$ the number of potential clients.\n",

    "The submission should consist of one line consisting of a single number 0≤N followed by a list of N ingredients to put on the only pizza available in the pizzeria, separated by spaces.
